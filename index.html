    <ul>
      <li>1930: Gladys Mae West was born into a farming family in Sutherland, Virginia. Growing up, she always knew she wasn't build for that struffle lifestyle, working from sun-up to sundown in the heat, so she learned to prioritize her studies early on.</li>
      <li>1948: She graduated at the top of her high school class and went on to go to Virginia State Univeristy (VSU) on a full scholarship, majoring in Mathematics.</li>
      <li>1952: Ms. West graduated from college.</li>
      <li>1955: She graduated with her Master's in Mathematics from VSU.</li>
      <li>1956: Gladys was hired to work for the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, becoming the second black woman ever hired and one of 4 black employees at the facility.</li>
      <li>1960s: She was part of a project that created the first satellite that could remotely sense oceans.</li>
      <li>1970s-1980s: Dr. West programmed an IBM supercomputer to deliver calculations that modeled the shape of the earth. This data was eventually used as the basis for the GPS systems we use today!</li>
      <li>1998: She retired from her job at the Naval Base after 42 years.</li>
      <li>2018: Gladys Mae West was inducted into the US Airforce Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame.</li>
